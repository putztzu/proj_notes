Competition

Although The Proposal is designed to promote competition, numbers of Participants in the Marketplace cannot sacrifice standards of quality and specified Competencies.

The estimated initial target market of Expanded Medical subscribers has an estimated value of approx 500 million dollars annually based on a minimal one User serviced once per year, with a total actual value many times that amount.

As Participants increase their numbers of Competencies and Users utilize their services more than once per year, it's likely the market size will grow exponentially, and the Participants will compete among themselves for how much of that expanding market they can capture.

To assist Participant startups, the Prize system seeks to provide significant monetary incentives to defray some of development costs. Investors should look upon this model favorably, Taxpayer watchdogs should appreciate the value of assisting the creation of high capacity Healthcare Services at the cost of sending 2 or 3 humans through medical school for each Participant.

Currently, the application already with the most developed features which can quickly become a Participant is IBM's Watson program. The author of The Proposal knows of no other entity that is as developed in technologies necessary to create a Participant application but believes that with sufficient incentives and resources, others will commit to becoming Participants as well although may require 1-3 years to catch up sufficiently to qualify for Stage 1. So, a major requirement of The Marketplace will be to define a fair playing field that both allows new Participants to develop and enter while also allowing more mature Participants to evolve and innovate.

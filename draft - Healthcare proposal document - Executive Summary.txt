Executive Summary
Healthcare services are provided by Artificial Intelligence solutions. The leading/bleeding edge of AI wed with Big Data currently is capable of many of the common diagnostic and screening which is part of regular "Checkups" in combination with inexpensive sensors for such things as blood pressure, pulse, temperature, etc. Any of these and additional tests including submitting samples can be done inexpensively at a neighborhood clinic or through the mail.

The leading example of this type of Artificial Intelligence is IBM's Watson program as described in the CBS program "60 minutes." From a general technological point of view, the capabiliites described in the program are very reasonable and well within current known computing capabilities and the requirement to "Send Watson to Medical School for Family Practice" for example would be far less than what was required to send Watson to Medical School to become a Cancer Specialist.

To the lay person, access to vast amounts of Big Data is similar to "hunman experience," the more data an AI program has access to, the better it can construct models and relationships that are similar to diagnostics by a human. Still, today and perhaps fundamentally there is and may always be a fundamental difference between AI capabilities and humans... AI can be very good at correlating data, and that is probably what a great number of humans also do. But, it's questionable whether an AI will ever be capable of inspiration and invention like humans can (but in actuality very few humans are really capable of).

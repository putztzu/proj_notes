Veteran's Administration

How this Proposal might be able to alleviate Veteran's Administration healthcare is unknown to this author.

At the least, it's this author's impression that long wait lines are often for simple screening and diagnosis, similar to ordinary checkups, so at least that might be impactful but beyond that there needs to be a comprehensive list of needed and unfulfilled services which can then be analyzed for what can be addressed as Competencies.

This is an area where a knowlegeable contribution is welcomed.

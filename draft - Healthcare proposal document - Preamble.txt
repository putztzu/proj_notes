Preamble
This document is intended to be a source for discussion and action.
Although details are described, the details are only intended to provide context and understanding and are not in any way to be thought of as immutable or legal.

It should also be noted that The Proposal describes a general framework for creating a technological Public-Private Partnership based solution that probably does not exist today in any form and will impact only a small but likely very significant part of Healthcare.

It is also hopeful that with the successful creation of The Proposal that it should become the blueprint for creating similar Marketplaces for technological delivery of Healthcare Services in other areas, limited only by imagination and technological skills.

It should be noted and is repeated elsewhere that The Proposal is meant to address the root cause of the balance of Supply and Demand in Healthcare, and is completely oblivious to what might exist politically and whatever might be delivered by the ACA and the various "ACA fixes" currently being floated.

The Proposal has the potential to be considered at least as important as The Space Program's Moonshot with far-reaching consequences guaranteed to touch or influence directly or indirectly every individual in the United States and possibly the world, and felt for generations to come. It is also expected that The Proposal will be eventually recognized as a touchpoint in history for accelerating both pure Research & Development as well as speeding the results to benefit everyday people.

And yet, the projected cost for such a beneficial creation is currently projected to be infinitely smaller than the post-Sputnik Space Program.
